#### Throughout the cleaning and arranging raw data and further descriptive analysis, it is first showcased an overview of an overall performace in reading and math scores across all schools. Similarily, we focus on to illustrate of descriptive data on grade 9th students. Lastly, a summary of budget by school type is provided.

- First findings on background data, it is seen there are grade 9th to 12th students including in this dataset, an overall average of reading performance is higher than mathematic performance. There are also addition desriptive findings such as drop points at 25, 50 and 75 percentiles with standard deviations for each reading and mathematic performance.

- Secondly, by changing index for filtering for only 9th grade students, it is also found higher performance in reading than math in average, in addition, standard deviations are wider seen on mathematic perfomance than reading.

- Based on an analysis on school budgets by school types, public schools budget average is higher than charter school. Additionaly, there is a list of students counts for each schools is provided for further reference. Montgomery High School has most students among all, in contrast, Chang High School has the least students.

- Last but not least, a summary of mathematic performance for each grade brokendown by charter and pubic school is examed. As a result, it is found students at 9th grade in Charter schools has the best math score in average among others.

- There are also more data evaluation and analysis can be useful and helpful to picture the populations, for example we can trim down by each individule schools performance in reading and mathematic, along with schools' budget and students amounts to observe possible correlation.
